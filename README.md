# DBMS Course Project
- Designed a GUI application which takes in GD(Global Depth), LD(Local Depth), hash-function, and BFR(blocking factor).
- Displays how the scheme evolves after each insertion of a new key.
- extended the app to take attributes and set of Functional Dependencies, identify the keys, and check the highest normal form and suggests decomposition to the next normal form.
